            <h2>Part 4: Echoes of Terror</h2>
            The neon sign above the abandoned diner flickered erratically, casting a sickly glow on the rain-streaked asphalt. Outside, the wind howled like a banshee, rattling the boarded-up windows. Inside, the air hung thick with the smell of mildew and decay. Jack, his face a pale canvas etched with fear, huddled in a cracked booth, the tremor in his hands rattling the chipped coffee mug he held.
The events in the library felt like a fever dream, yet the unnatural strength coursing through his veins was a chilling reminder. The laughter echoing from the broken mirror still haunted him, a constant reminder of the monstrous entity that now resided within him.
He had run for days, the fear that had once paralyzed him now fueling the creature. It whispered promises of power, urging him to feed its insatiable hunger. Jack fought, clinging to the last vestiges of his humanity, but the struggle was taking its toll. Dark circles shadowed his eyes, a constant reminder of the nights spent wrestling with the entity within. His normally neat appearance had devolved into a disheveled mess, his once bright clothes now stained and muddied.
The diner door creaked open, a shaft of light slicing through the gloom. A figure, shrouded in a rain-soaked jacket, stepped inside. It was Iuvenes Mutant, the school bully, his face contorted in a sneer as he surveyed the desolate diner.
"What the hell is this place?" Iuvenes scoffed, his voice laced with a characteristic smirk. He flicked a lighter, illuminating the decaying interior. Cobwebs hung from the grimy ceiling, and dust motes danced in the sliver of light. Flies buzzed lazily around a cracked countertop, where remnants of a forgotten meal lay congealed.
Jack flinched, the creature within surging, its voice a venomous hiss in his mind. "Fear. Delicious fear."
Before Jack could stop himself, he lunged. Iuvenes, startled, let out a yelp as Jack's hands wrapped around his throat. The strength in Jack's grip was inhuman, his own eyes burning with an unholy red light.
The bully struggled, gasping for air, his face turning a sickly purple. In the back of his mind, Jack felt a flicker of horror, but the creature's hunger was too powerful to resist. He squeezed tighter, a guttural growl escaping his throat. The sounds echoed eerily in the abandoned diner, punctuated by Iuvenes' desperate gasps.
Moments later, Iuvenes went limp. Jack released his grip, his body racked with tremors. He stared at his hands, his stomach churning. The creature reveled in its feast, leaving only a hollow emptiness in its wake. What had he done? The realization hit him like a physical blow. He had become a monster, just like the one he'd faced in the library.
Despair threatened to consume him, but a flicker of defiance sparked in his eyes. He wouldn't succumb to this darkness. He had to find a way to stop it, to break free from the entity's hold. But how? His mind raced, searching for answers that seemed to slip away like smoke through his numb fingers.
A harsh cough rattled his chest, reminding him of the chilling reality. He stumbled out of the booth, his legs weak and wobbly. The diner floorboards creaked under his weight, the silence broken only by the relentless drumming of rain against the roof.
A faint glint on the counter caught his eye. It was Iuvenes' phone, its screen cracked but still illuminated. Hesitantly, Jack picked it up. Maybe, just maybe, there was something on the phone that could help him. His fingers trembled as he unlocked it, a wave of nausea washing over him as he saw the victim's terrified face staring back at him from a recent selfie.
Suddenly, a ringtone pierced the silence. The screen flashed with an unknown name. Fear tightened its icy grip around his heart. Jack answered the call hesitantly, a hoarse whisper escaping his lips.
"Jack?" A familiar voice echoed through the phone. It was Ghenna. Relief flooded his body, so intense it almost made him forget the chilling truth. Ghenna was supposed to be dead. "Ghenna? Is that really you?"
"Jack, where are you?" Ghenna's voice sounded frantic. "There's something wrong with me. I keep seeing… shadows…"
The call ended abruptly. Ghenna's words hung in the air, a new terror gnawing at Jack's already frayed nerves. Was she infected too? The creature within him stirred, a sinister whisper echoing in his mind. "More fear… more power…"
Jack slammed the phone on the counter, the diner echoing with the sound. Rage.
