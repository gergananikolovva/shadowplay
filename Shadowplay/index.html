            <h2>Part 1: The Abandoned Mine </h2>
            Rain lashed against the rusted metal siding of the old mine shaft, the wind howling like a banshee.
            Huddled inside the derelict building, four teenagers huddled together, shivering. Magnus, the athletic
            one with a mysterious chest scar and a terrible allergy, sniffled, his face pale. Ghenna, the
            dark-haired, Stephen King-loving girl, gnawed on a fingernail, her usual bright eyes dull with fear.
            Jack, the freckled Brit with a stutter and painted nails, clutched a rusty crowbar like a lifeline.
            And finally, Umbra, the quiet, red-haired artist with a penchant for horror movies, stared blankly at
            the darkness that beckoned from the mine entrance. Their ill-advised adventure to explore the infamous
            "Howling Caverns" had taken a nasty turn. A sudden cave-in had blocked the entrance, trapping them
            inside the decaying building. Fear hung heavy in the air, punctuated by the occasional crash of debris
            outside. Magnus, ever the optimist, took charge. "Okay, people," he said, his voice a touch raspy from
            allergies, "panicking won't help. We need a plan." He rummaged through his backpack, pulling out a
            crumpled granola bar and a dented first-aid kit. "Here, Ghenna, have a bite. Sugar helps." Ghenna
            took the bar with a mumbled thanks. Her eyes lingered on Magnus's chest, where a jagged scar,
            resembling claw marks, peeked out from his shirt. It was an unspoken question, a silent reminder of
            the rumors surrounding him - rumors about an encounter with a wild animal years ago. Suddenly, a
            booming voice echoed from outside the building. "Hello! Anyone in there?" Hope flickered in their
            eyes. Jack, surprising everyone with an uncharacteristic burst of bravery, grabbed a metal sheet and
            used it to create a makeshift banging instrument. "Over here!" he yelled, his voice surprisingly
            strong. A creaking sound followed by a shaft of light pierced the darkness as the building's rusted
            door groaned open. A burly man in a rain-soaked coat stood there, a worried frown etched on his face.
            He introduced himself as Old Man Henry, the town's caretaker. Relief washed over them. But just as
            quickly, it curdled into dread. Henry mentioned the dangers of the mine. Apparently, strange
            occurrences had plagued the area for years – disappearances, unexplained noises, a chilling sense of
            being watched. Ignoring their growing fear, they convinced Henry to help them pry open the cave-in.
            Hours of backbreaking work passed, fueled by dwindling hope and the occasional protein bar from
            Magnus's backpack. Finally, a narrow passage opened, barely big enough for one person. The air turned
            thick and cold. Old Man Henry, refusing to let them go alone, volunteered to go first. He squeezed
            through the opening, muttering a prayer. Minutes ticked by. Silence. A creeping dread gnawed at them.
            Jack’s grip on the crowbar tightened. Ghenna whimpered, clutching Umbra's hand. Finally, they heard a
            muffled scream. Then, another crash. Without hesitation, Magnus clambered through the opening. Ghenna
            and Jack started to protest, but Umbra stopped them. Her previously vacant blue eyes flashed with a
            strange resolve. "Wait," she said, her voice strangely calm. "Don't follow him."
