            <h2>Part 5: Discordant Notes</h2>
            Simone Corniger, a wisp of a girl with a wild mane of brown hair and a penchant for metal music, sat hunched over her laptop, the pale glow of the screen illuminating her dark circles. The recent string of murders in Ruse had her blood pumping with a morbid curiosity that even her usual dose of heavy bass couldn't drown out.
            Two victims in two weeks, both seemingly random, both found with expressions of pure terror etched on their faces. The police were baffled, the town on edge, and Simone, an aspiring journalist with a nose for trouble, was obsessed.
            Her cramped apartment, usually adorned with band posters and dark-hued trinkets, now resembled a homicide detective's war room. Newspaper clippings with grainy photos of the victims were pinned to a corkboard, connected by red yarn that snaked across the space like a morbid spiderweb. Notes scrawled in messy handwriting littered the desk, each one a thread in the tangled web of Simone's investigation.
            A knock on the door startled her. Briefly considering ignoring it, she sighed and shuffled over, muttering under her breath. On the other side stood Tace Serpens, the school jock and epitome of everything Simone disliked. His blonde hair was slicked back, and his usual arrogant smirk was replaced with a frown.
            "Simone," he said, his voice gruff. "Is this about the murders?"
            Simone raised an eyebrow, surprised. Tace wasn't known for his intellectual pursuits. "Uh, yeah," she said, cautiously letting him in. "Why the sudden interest?"
            Tace hesitated, then gestured towards the corkboard. "I knew Iuvenes," he muttered. "He was a jerk, but…" His voice trailed off, a flicker of emotion crossing his face that Simone couldn't quite decipher.
            "Look," she said, gesturing to the mess on the desk. "I'm not saying you're involved, but any information helps. Did he seem… different lately? Afraid of anything?"
            Tace considered it for a moment. "He did mention seeing shadows," he admitted. "Said they followed him, whispered stuff." Simone leaned back in her chair, a shiver running down her spine. Shadows? It echoed Ghenna's panicked call that Jack had received in the diner. Could it be a coincidence?
            "Did he say what the shadows whispered?" Simone pressed, her curiosity outweighing her usual apprehension towards Tace.
            Tace shook his head. "Just mumbled something about a monster." He scoffed, but Simone noticed a hint of unease in his eyes.
            "Well, thanks for that, Tace," she said, a glimmer of hope flickering within her. Maybe there was a connection after all. Perhaps these weren't random killings but something… more.
            Simone spent the next few hours scouring the web, searching for anything related to whispers, shadows, and monstrous creatures. The results were a mix of folklore and fringe theories, none of which offered any concrete answers. Frustration gnawed at her, but she refused to give up. She owed it to the victims, owed it to the town living in fear, and owed it, deep down, to a strange sense of responsibility she couldn't quite name.
            Suddenly, her phone chimed. It was a text from an unknown number. "Looking for answers? Meet me at the old library, midnight." The message sent a jolt of fear through her, but the journalist's fire in her burned bright. This could be her lead, her chance to crack the case open. Glancing at Tace, who was engrossed in a news report on his phone, she made a split-second decision.
            "Hey, Tace," she said, her voice surprisingly steady. "Want to help me investigate something?"
