            <h2>Part 3: Feast of Shadows</h2>
            The library echoed with Ghenna's scream, bouncing off the ancient tomes like a death knell. Jack, frozen in disbelief, watched as Umbra, his once quiet friend, morphed into the monstrous silhouette they'd witnessed moments ago. Tendrils of dark energy swirled around her, emanating from the broken mirror clutched in her hand.
"Umbra… why?" he stammered, his voice raspy with shock.
Umbra's crimson eyes gleamed with a predatory hunger. "Fear," she hissed, her voice distorted and unrecognizable. "It fuels me. It sustains me." Her form shifted, becoming more monstrous, claws replacing fingertips and jagged teeth replacing her once-normal smile.
Panic surged through Jack. He was alone, his crowbar useless against the creature before him. But a flicker of defiance sparked in his eyes. He wouldn't go down without a fight.
"You'll never win," Umbra taunted, advancing towards the whimpering Ghenna. Jack lunged, tackling the creature and knocking the mirror from its grasp. The silver surface hit the ground with a shattering crack, and the remaining moonlight tears evaporated, leaving a faint, ethereal scent in the air.
Umbra shrieked in frustration, the tendrils of darkness around her flickering erratically. Without the constant influx of fear from the ritual, she seemed weaker, more vulnerable.
"There's another way," Jack yelled, his voice surprisingly steady for someone facing a terrifying monster. He remembered the inscription on the bone fragment they'd found – "Seek the one untamed by fear, its essence lies within." His gaze darted around the library, landing on the alchemist's scroll with the moonlight tears instructions. A desperate plan formed in his mind.
Jack snatched the scroll, waving it frantically in front of the creature. "Look! Fear! Delicious, sweet fear!" It was a gamble, but seeing his only advantage fading, he had no choice.
Umbra's eyes narrowed, focusing on the scroll. Hunger warred with caution in her expression. Jack could almost feel the monster's internal struggle as it weighed the meager fear emanating from the scroll against the potential for a larger feast.
Suddenly, with a snarl, Umbra lunged for the scroll. Jack sidestepped, the creature crashing into a bookshelf. The impact sent a cascade of dusty books tumbling down, momentarily blocking its path.
Seizing the opportunity, Jack ran. He didn't know where he was going, only that he needed to get out, to find help, to warn someone. His lungs burned, legs aching, but he didn't dare look back.
He burst out of the hidden entrance, collapsing onto the rain-soaked grass. The storm had abated, revealing a pale crescent moon hanging low in the sky. Relief washed over him, so intense it almost took his breath away. He was alive.
But the elation was short-lived. He looked back towards the abandoned building, where the library lay hidden beneath. A faint, chilling laughter echoed through the night, sending shivers down his spine. Jack knew then that his fight wasn't over. He had escaped the library, but the monster that wore Umbra's face – the creature fueled by fear – was still out there. He alone knew its secret, and he had a responsibility to warn others. As dawn painted the sky with streaks of pink and orange, Jack stumbled towards the town, forever marked by the horrors he had witnessed, his stutter now a constant reminder of the night he faced a monster disguised as a friend.
